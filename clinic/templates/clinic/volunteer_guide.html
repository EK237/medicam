    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>Thank you and welcome to <a href="https://doc19.org">doc19.org</a>, a website that was created to help connect those who need help during the COVID-19 crisis with volunteers who are willing to listen and give a hand. Your help is much appreciated. This guide was created to help orient you to your role as a volunteer. It's still a work in progress, so please <a href="mailto:contact@doc19.org">let us know</a> if you have feedback.</p>
    <p>Please familiarize yourself with the entire guide, including associated information and resources, to be better prepared to answer questions.</p>
    <p>Volunteers may provide the following services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Triage</li>
      <li>Emotional support</li>
      <li>Referral to official resources</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For liability reasons, we ask that you do not to give individual medical advice. Ensure that callers are aware of this before you proceed.</p>
    <p>We recommend the following resources:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>US: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">CDC Coronavirus Self-Checker</a></li>
      <li>Canada: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19.html">Government of Canada Coronavirus website</a></li>
      <li>UK: <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/">NHS Coronavirus advice</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Everything you say is your responsibility. We cannot be held responsible for information provided to callers.</p>
    <p>How you approach calls is left up to your judgement. In the next section, we'll set out some suggestions for introducing yourself.</p>

    <a id="how-to-introduce-yourself"></a>
    <h4>How to introduce yourself</h4>
    <p>You can say:</p>
    <p class="pull-quote">
      Hi there, I'm [name]. I'm here to help you today as a volunteer. [Before we continue, I would like to let you know that I am not a licensed medical professional.] I can provide you with information in order to help you make a well-informed decision. However, I can't offer medical advice.
    </p>
    <p>Or:</p>
    <p class="pull-quote">
      Hello, my name is [name] and I am a volunteer. [Before we proceed, I would like to let you know that I'm not yet a licensed medical professional.] I'm here to provide you with information in order to help you make a well-informed decision; but please be aware that I can't offer medical advice.
    </p>
    <p>If the caller agrees to proceed:</p>
    <p class="pull-quote">
      Which country do you currently live in?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If US/Canada, follow respective websites and resources.</li>
      <li>If from elsewhere, follow CDC guidance but be aware that self-checker is intended for people currently located in the US.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Follow up with:</p>
    <p class="pull-quote">
      How can I help you today?
    </p>

    <a id="if-you-are-asked-about"></a>
    <h4>If you are asked about...</h4>

    <a id="symptoms"></a>
    <h5>Symptoms</h5>
    <p class="pull-quote">
      I'm going to walk you through the tool provided by [public health authority] for the Coronavirus. Just note that this tool is not intended for diagnosis or treatment of disease, including COVID-19, as that judgment must be left up to your healthcare provider. Can we begin?
    </p>
    <p>If <b>yes</b>: ask the questions from the tool. If <b>no</b>: give them the link to the tool.</p>

    <a id="emotional-support"></a>
    <h5>Emotional support</h5>
    <p>Your role is best served by identifying the problem that the caller has, not to offer personal advice on solving the problem.</p>
    <p>If a caller is suicidal, keep them online, and have them call the National Suicide Hotline: 1-800-273-8255 (US)</p>
    <p>
      What you should do:
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure you compliment them (You're so strong for talking about this.)</li>
        <li>Make sure you empathize (I can see how that would make you feel, Iâ€™m sorry that that happened)</li>
        <li>Listen!</li>
      </ul>
      If you can identify a problem that you think can be addressed with a resource, then offer the resource.
    </p>

    <a id="information-about-covid19"></a>
    <h5>Information about COVID-19</h5>
    <p>Familiarize yourself with our <a href="{% url 'faq' %}">frequently asked questions</a> page. If you don't know the answer to an question, please direct the caller to one of the official resources. You can also help them search for the information they need.</p>
    <p>COVID-19 is a highly contagious viral infection that transmits airborne, through sneezing, coughing, or contact with shared surfaces. People who develop an infection typically do after 2-14 days after contact with an infected individual. Common symptoms are fever, cough, or shortness of breath.</p>
    <p>Right now, it's important not to travel unless absolutely necessary. When going out, practice social distancing and stand at least 6 feet away from people. If someone is sick and must go outside, they should wear a face mask.</p>
